# physics-engine
A comprehensive physics engine for 2D graphics in C. 

## Outline 
the project abstraction follows the pattern of using Scene, Body, and Polygons to encapsulate all the objects on the screen. The following physical properties can then be added to teh bodies to create a realistic and smooth movement of graphics in the 2D space. 

#Physics Mechanisms Included
- Destructive Collisions
- Elastic collisions
- Physics Collisions
- Impulse
- Spring Effects
- Forces
- Newtonian Gravitational Forces
- Drag Force
